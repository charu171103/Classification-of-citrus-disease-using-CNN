# Classification-of-citrus-disease-using-CNN

This project aims to classify citrus fruit diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The provided code implements a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras for training on a dataset containing images of citrus fruits affected by various diseases.


*Dataset*

The dataset used for training and testing the model is obtained from Dataset for Classification of Citrus Diseases on Kaggle. It consists of images of citrus fruits categorized into two classes: Blackspot and Canker.This dataset is by Jeremiah Harmsen on Kaggle.

*Model Architecture*

The CNN model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and dense layers. The final layer utilizes a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.


*Usage*

->Ensure you have TensorFlow and other required dependencies installed.

->Set up the paths to the training and testing datasets in the code.

->Customize the CNN model architecture and training parameters if needed.

->Run the code to train the model and evaluate its performance.


*Results*

After training the model for a certain number of epochs, the training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the training progress and performance.
